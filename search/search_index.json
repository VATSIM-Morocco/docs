The procedures in this LoA are for use on the VATSIM Network only and should never be adopted for real world use. General Procedures Traffic shall be transferred to the neighboring sector 10nm before reaching its boundary. Traffic shall be transferred complying with the separation guidelines as of RVSM. (5nm horizontally / 1000ft vertically). In case of having a sequence of traffic, all with the same destination. Extra 5nm shall be applied horizontally. Making a total horizontal separation of 10nm. In case of traffic being transferred while climbing or descending. Traffic shall be transferred 3000ft before reaching its Cleared Flight Level. Cruising Flight Levels Everything going towards mainland Spain will fly an EVEN Flight Level. Everything going towards the Canary Islands will fly an ODD Flight Level. Sector Layout Neighbouring Airports with Coordinated Descent Tanger (GMTT) The location of Tanger airport makes coordination quite challenging as 90% of the descent of planes inbound from the north will be handled by Spanish ATC. In consequence the arrival shall be given by Spanish ATC as well. All transfers regarding planes inbound Tanger from Spanish ATC will be done directly to Tanger Approach (121.2) if online, otherwise to Casablanca Radar. Arrivals RWY 28 (Preferential) RWY 10 Altitude @ FIX Transfer Point ABIRO ABIRO 2A ABIRO 1A FL100@BAMBA 10nm prior BAMBA NOLRO NOLRO 2A NOLRO 1A FL60@ADKIM 10nm prior ADKIM LAMAD LAMAD 2A LAMAD 1A FL100@GALTO 10nm prior GALTO Departures All Departures towards Spanish Airspace will be instructed to climb to FL100 and 3000ft before reaching that altitude will be transferred to the appropriate Spanish ATS. Tetouan (GMTN) Just like Tanger, Tetouan is quite a challenging airport when it comes to coordination as well. Tetouan doesn\u2019t receive as much traffic so the arrival procedures are quite a bit easier. Tetouan does not have any STAR procedure and only one runway has an established approach procedure. Arrivals Arrivals shall be instructed to descent to FL70 and be transferred 10 nm before reaching GALTO to Tetouan Tower (procedural) 119.0. Departures Departures will be instructed to climb to FL60 and will be transferred to the appropriate Spanish ATS 3000ft before reaching the cleared flight level. M\u00e1laga (LEMG) The sunny airport in Costa del Sol might not be as challenging as Tanger when it comes to ATC coordination but still is situated close enough for it to have some coordination to be done between the two ATS providers. Arrivals RWY 13/12 (Preferential) RWY 31 PIMOS PIMOS 1Q PIMOS 1J PEKOP PEKOP 2Q PEKOP 1Z VJF VJF 2K VJF 2J Gibraltar (LXGB) The strategically well-situated British airport makes coordination quite complicated. As a reminder, Gibraltar is controlled by VATSIMUK. Arrivals Arrivals from the south to Gibraltar are unlikely but possible. There are two possible entries: Via BAMBA, in which case arrival will be provided by Spanish controllers and later on transferred to Casablanca for further descent. From BARPA to PIMOS the ATC service will be provided by Gibraltar Approach. If offline, traffic may be told to switch over to Unicom. Via GALTO, in which case the arrival will be provided by Casablanca and later on transferred directly to Gibraltar Approach. Melilla (GEML) For the purpose of simplification Casablanca has delegated a box of airspace around Melilla to the Area Control Center of Seville. Thanks to that, planes transiting from Spain to Melilla won\u2019t have to change unnecessarily between Frequencies. As seen in the image below, this delegation of airspace goes from surface up to FL60. From FL70 onwards, this airspace is controlled by Casablanca Moroccan Sahara ATC coverage and services provided FIR/UIR Canarias Vertical Limits ATS Unit Airspace Classification SFC-FL145 N/a G FL145-195 Canarias Radio C FL195-660 Canarias Radio C Radar surveillance is not available, in consequence, procedural control is used by means of position reports. Local Airports There are two main airports in the Moroccan Sahara: Dakhla international airport (GMMH), and Hassan 1st international airport (GMML) in Laayoune. Both airports are controlled by Morocco and have their approach stations. Traffic coming from the north and heading to GMML shall remain under Casablanca Radar. However, traffic with destination GMMH shall be transferred from Casablanca Radar to Canarias Radio \u201cGCCO_CTR\u201d 10nm before the waypoint \u201cSOLNA\u201d. GCCO_CTR makes the handoff to GMMH_APP when cleared to FL120.

This clearance includes a SID, and pilots can expect an initial climb to FL050. Please note that a separate clearance for pushback is still required, even if you have already received your start-up clearance. If you are not able to begin pushback or start-up within 5 minutes of receiving your clearance, please plan accordingly and only request your en route clearance when you are prepared to proceed.

This TSAT indicates the anticipated time for you to receive approval for start-up/pushback. If you request start-up while also requesting your en route clearance, your TSAT will be provided simultaneously. However, if you have not requested a start-up clearance, it is your responsibility to inform ATC when you are prepared.

Additionally, when filing your flight plan, you will be assigned a CTOT (Calculated Take Off Time). Your CTOT is the estimated time for when you will be cleared for take-off. Please note that your actual departure time may be 5 minutes earlier or 10 minutes later than your CTOT. Taxi Ground movement at GMMN is straightforward. After starting your engines and completing all necessary checklists, expect to receive clearance to taxi to your assigned runway from the closest apron exit. You will then be instructed to hold short of the runway at the designated holding point. Before crossing the runway, it is important to establish contact with the Tower controller. Even if Runway 17L/35R is not in use, you must receive clearance before crossing. Take-off Once you are next in sequence for departure, the Tower controller will instruct you to line-up and wait. Please complete all necessary pre-departure checklists before receiving clearance to line-up for departure. As part of the take-off clearance, Tower will include instructions for you to contact Approach on the designated frequency once airborne. Make sure to follow the initial climb that was provided in your start-up clearance. If you are unsure, please confirm with Tower before takeoff. The transition altitude for GMMN is 4000 feet. After take-off, pay close attention to the initial routing of your SID and comply with altitude and speed restrictions as per charts. Arrivals When flying the arrival, make sure to follow the published altitude restrictions and comply with any ATC instructions. Before arriving at the Initial Approach Fix (IAF), expect the controller to either clear you for the approach, instruct you to hold or vector you. The default approach type for GMMN is the ILS-Z if it is available, but ATC may assign a different approach type based on traffic and operational conditions. When cleared for the ILS approach from the IAF, it is expected that you follow the published route on the approach chart and descend via the arrival to intercept the glideslope at the appropriate altitude depending on the active configuration. Make sure to comply with any ATC instructions and fly the approach with precision.","title":"Casablanca MV"},{"location":"pilots/briefings/casablanca/#casablanca-mv-gmmn","text":"","title":"Casablanca MV (GMMN)"},{"location":"pilots/briefings/casablanca/#general","text":"","title":"General"},{"location":"pilots/briefings/casablanca/#scenery","text":"Scenery usage is strongly recommended.
