This clearance includes a SID, and pilots can expect an initial climb to FL050. Please see the ATIS for the current runway in use.

To ensure a smooth operation, we recommend that you plan to be ready at least 5 minutes prior to your assigned TSAT (you are expected to recall Delivery 5 minutes before TSAT). Additionally, when filing your flight plan, you will be assigned a CTOT (Calculated Take Off Time). Your CTOT is the estimated time for when you will be cleared for take-off. Please note that your actual departure time may be 5 minutes earlier or 10 minutes later than your CTOT. Taxi Ground movement at GMMN is straightforward. After starting your engines and completing all necessary checklists, expect to receive clearance to taxi to your assigned runway from the closest apron exit. You will then be instructed to hold short of the runway at the designated holding point. Before crossing the runway, it is important to establish contact with the Tower controller. Even if Runway 17L/35R is not in use, you must receive clearance before crossing. Take-off Once you are next in sequence for departure, the Tower controller will instruct you to line-up and wait. Please complete all necessary pre-departure checklists before receiving clearance to line-up for departure. As part of the take-off clearance, Tower will include instructions for you to contact Approach on the designated frequency once airborne. Make sure to follow the initial climb that was provided in your start-up clearance. If you are unsure, please confirm with Tower before takeoff. The transition altitude for GMMN is 4000 feet. After take-off, pay close attention to the initial routing of your SID and comply with altitude and speed restrictions as per charts. Arrivals When flying the arrival, make sure to follow the published altitude restrictions and comply with any ATC instructions. Before arriving at the Initial Approach Fix (IAF), expect the controller to either clear you for the approach, instruct you to hold or vector you. The default approach type for GMMN is the ILS-Z if it is available, but ATC may assign a different approach type based on traffic and operational conditions. When cleared for the ILS approach from the IAF, it is expected that you follow the published route on the approach chart and descend via the arrival to intercept the glideslope at the appropriate altitude depending on the active configuration. Make sure to comply with any ATC instructions and fly the approach with precision.","title":"Casablanca MV"},{"location":"pilots/briefings/casablanca/#casablanca-mv-gmmn","text":"","title":"Casablanca MV (GMMN)"},{"location":"pilots/briefings/casablanca/#general","text":"","title":"General"},{"location":"pilots/briefings/casablanca/#scenery","text":"Scenery usage is strongly recommended.
